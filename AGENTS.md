# AI-generated commit messages

When generating a commit message then follow these rules:

- follow the rules for conventional commits.
  - `fix` for changes in behavior
  - `refactor` when having rewritten code and does not change behavior.
  - `docs` when only documentation has changed.
  - `chore` for other things not affecting behavior in the application.
  - when updating dependencies then use `fix(deps)` for changes in production dependencies (`dependencies` in [package.json](package.json)) and use `chore(deps)` for changes in development dependencies (`devDependencies` in [package.json](package.json)).
- keep the commit message short and concise
- follow the pattern from existing commit messages.
