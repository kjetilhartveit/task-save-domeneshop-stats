Write some more context for the agent.

## Plan

- [ ] First step
- [ ] Second step
- [ ] Third step
    - [ ] Substep 1
    - [ ] Substep 2

### Execution of plan

- You should only work in the `{branch name}` branch.
- You should git commit and push regularly, particularly after making many code changes.
- After every step you should tick the step off the plan and make sure everything is committed and pushed.
- Be autonomous, but if you need my input then ask for it in [QA.md](QA.md).
